## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to examine the number of times countries of the world are mentioned in Jeopardy! answers and questions. To acheive this, we extensively used mapping techniques from `ggplot2`, `leaflet`, and `plotly`. We also examined the relationship between number of mentions and characteristics such as gross domestic product (GDP) and land area.
